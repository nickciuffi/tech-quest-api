# tech-quest API

This is a project to practice my **Next.js**, **Typescript** and **Node.js** abilities. <br>
This project has three parts: <br>
1. The front-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest;
2. the back-end: Which you can see in this repository;
3. The admin front-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest-admin; 

# Tech stack:

For the front-end I used **Node.js** and **express**.
All the data is stored in a **MYSQL** database.<br>
The database and the Node.js application are hosted as containers in a **Google Cloud Virtual machine**.<br>
For the hosting, I used **NGINX**, **PM2**, **GITHUB** and **DOCKER**.

# Conclusion

For me this was the hardest part of the project, considering all my difficulties in the hosting process and the big amount of bugs I had to fix in the code and in the infrastructure
